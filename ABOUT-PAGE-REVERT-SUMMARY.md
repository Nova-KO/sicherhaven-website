2. **Test About links**: Click "About" in footer on any page
3. **Expected result**: Should navigate to homepage (index.html)
4. **Verify**: `About.html` should return 404 (file not found)

- `About.html` - Removed completely

### **Updated**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **About.html is permanently deleted** - if you need it back, it would need to be recreated
- **All About links now point to homepage** - this matches the original template behavior
- **Contact page remains unchanged** - still has Sicherhaven content
- **404 redirects still work** - all wrong links still redirect to 404.html
